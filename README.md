# Mazes

A variety of work with JavaScript canvas programs in relation to mazes. The directories are each a seperate project using the same fundamental Recursive Backtracker on a Depth-First Search for maze generation.

`Generator` showcases the algorithm at a slowed animation speed to observe the process of maze generation. The size and speed can be modified in the main JavaScript program.

`Racer` is a game or puzzle wherein the user must navigate the dot from the beginning top-left corner to the ending bottom-right corner using the arrow keys. The size can be adjusted in the main JavaScript program.

`Wallpaper` features a fullscreen canvas that fills the screen with a maze generation animation with a color gradient background.
